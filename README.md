# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under database directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
	- __Python__
		- [Crime in Boston](https://github.com/geijinchan/Data-science-Notebooks/blob/main/EDA/Crime%20in%20Bostson.ipynb): Exploratory Data Analysis of crimes in Boston dataset hosted on Kaggle. Demonstrates extraction of useful features from different variables. Data is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/AnalyzeBoston/crimes-in-boston)
		- [Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/geijinchan/Data-science-Notebooks/blob/main/EDA/titanic.ipynb): Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.
		
	_Tools: Pandas, Folium, Seaborn and Matplotlib_

- ### Open Source Computer Vision Library(OpenCV)
	- I have done few small projects and [basics of OpenCV](https://github.com/geijinchan/Data-science-Notebooks/blob/main/Open%20CV/Basics.ipynb) like [face detection](https://github.com/geijinchan/Data-science-Notebooks/blob/main/Open%20CV/Face%20Attendence/Face%20matching.ipynb), [template matching](https://github.com/geijinchan/Data-science-Notebooks/blob/main/Open%20CV/Template%20Matching/template_matching.py). I've implemented Hough Transormation in few places so please don't bother asking how I did it. Like I said I'm still learning
	_Tools: face_recognition,cv2_

- ### Micro Projects: 

	- __Python__
		- [ML with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/geijinchan/Data-science-Notebooks/blob/main/ML%20micro%20projects/Linear%20Regression.ipynb): Using Logistic Regression to predict the RND value of a company.
		- [ML with K Nearest Neighbours(Classifier)](https://github.com/geijinchan/Data-science-Notebooks/blob/main/ML%20micro%20projects/KNN(Classifier).ipynb): Using KNN to classify the best car for a customers requirement.
        - [ML with K Nearest Neighbours(Regressor)](https://github.com/geijinchan/Data-science-Notebooks/blob/main/ML%20micro%20projects/KNN(Regressor).ipynb): Using KNN to classify  to find the best credit for a customer.
		- [ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests](https://github.com/geijinchan/Data-science-Notebooks/blob/main/ML%20micro%20projects/Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forests.ipynb): Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict whether a lender will pay their loan back.
